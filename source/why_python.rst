Why using Python
===================

Easy to Learn
------------------

As you will see, Python is extremely easy to get started with. Python has a simple syntax, yet powerful enough for most applications. 


Simple but powerful
----------------------

The language has an easy and clean syntax with simple semantics. Similar to C, Algol but it is also an OOP language; OOP is not mandatory (unlike CPP). No extra symbol to start or end a statement (no @, $ symbole like in perl); No special character at the end (like ; in C). 

The hello example is as simple as ::

    print("hello")

Quick to start with
----------------------

The main reasons being:

* no declaration required. It is a high-level language
* many built-in data structures are already available: dictionary, lists... 
* no need for memory handling: there is a memory garbage collector


Interpreted
----------------

Python can be run, debugged and tested interactively in the python interpreter. 

MultiPlatform and portable
---------------------------

Byte code can be executed on different platforms.

Battery included
-------------------

* Many modules are already provided by default to handle HTML, HTTP, GUI, databases. Ideal for web scripting and data handling.
* There is a rich set of external libraries especially for science (matplotlib, pandas, networkx)

Extensible and flexible
----------------------------

* Python can be used to connect many applications or separate software components in a simple manner.
* scalable: support large program thanks to a better structure and support than standard script languages. Provide tools to build modular application with modules, packages but also GUI interface
* large program can be organised into smaller modules that can still interact with each other or built-in modules


Drawbacks
-----------

* indentation probably intimidates beginners but after a couple of hours of coding it becomes natural.
* slower than compiled languages.
