`Beginning Python` from Norton et al., 2005
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. [Norton] Peter Norton, Alex Samuel, David Aitel, Eric Foster-Johnson, Leonard Richardson, Jason Diamond, Aleatha Parker, Michael Roberts, *Begining Python*, 2005. 

The first 120 pages are really for beginners. It does not really cover many aspects of the language but only variables, sequences and basic syntax. However, from chapter 7-8 standard modules are used to illustrate examples, which adds a great value to the book. Then chapter 9 discuss functional programming. Chapter 10 is about modules and is clear and interesting. Chapter 11 introduce the os and re modules; this is just an overview. Chapter 12 about testing uses previous chapter content to illustrate the usage of unittest. Chapter 13 is about GUI with PyGTK and glade; if you use something else it still provides information about GUI programming; some explanations about different alternative such as wxPython and PyQt. Chapter 14 is about databases both persistent and relational. If you want to learn about XML, the chapter 15 will give you a good insight. Chapter 16 is about networking. Chapter 17 is about C extensions. Chapter 18 about a case study on writing a shareware or commercial software. Chapter 19 covers mathematics and Chapter 20 is called Pyithin in entreprise. I should admit that I have not read that one yet. Then there is a long chapter about Web Services (chapter 21). This start to be very technical but if you are interested in this subject, it is definitely a good and worthy reference. And it ends up with again a subject I have seen in many books: bridges betznn Java and Python.

`A byte of Python` from swaproop C.H. v1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. [SWAROOP] Swaroop C.H., *A byte of Python*, 2005

Well written introduction to Python. This shortbook is nicely written and reviews all you need to start programming in python. There is a nice introduction explaining the advantages of Python. However, it is really just an introduction. It does not go in depth and you will quickly need another book to go ahead with Python. It does not discuss advanced topics such as generator or decorator and hardly cover the object oriented possiblities!

.. [Fehily] Chris Fehily, *Python* (Visual Quickstart Guide collection)

Excellent collection to learn a language. I enjoyed the one about XML and javascript. This one about Python has the same qualities: precise, clear, lots of examples and just nice. It covers all Python language but is suitable for beginners only. It starts to discuss classes in the last chapter so don't expect to do object oriented with this book. Nevertheless, again, this is an enjoyable book to learn Python.

Again, an excellent collection to learn Python language. Same comments as the one from Fehily.


Making use of Python 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. [Gupta] Rashi Gupta, *Making use of Python*


The first chapters (1-9) give a good overview of the language while the remaining chapters focus mostly on CGI programming and network protocols. Although it is clear and full of examples, I have a mix feeling about it. Maybe examples are a bit longish or layout not as good as other books (note that I read the 2002 edition so hopefully newest version are nicer). For beginners, I would recommend a book that covers only beginner topics since the networking chapters would not be of interest. For people interested to start with CGI and networking, it could be a starting point but not as good as other references.
